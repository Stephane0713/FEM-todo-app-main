![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi !

This is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) project.
The mockups and images are provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
I will be developing the Frontend of this project meaning (at least for now).

## Here is the job i have to do :

-   [ ] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [ ] Add new todos to the list
-   [ ] Mark todos as complete
-   [ ] Delete todos from the list
-   [ ] Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   [ ] Clear all completed todos
-   [ ] Toggle light and dark mode
-   [ ] **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## The techs I aim to use :

-   HTML/CSS/JS (of course)
-   SCSS
-   TypeScript
-   Parcel
